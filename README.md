# 16-bit Pipelined RISC Processor (Logisim Evolution)

This repository contains the full implementation of a 16-bit RISC pipelined processor designed and simulated using [Logisim-Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution). The project was developed as part of the COE301 - Computer Architecture & Assembly Language course (Term 242, Spring 2025).

## üß† Overview

The processor implements a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture with the following features:
- 16-bit word size
- 7 general-purpose registers (R1-R7), R0 hardwired to 0
- 1 program counter (PC)
- 3 instruction formats: R-type, I-type, and J-type
- Custom ISA with 24+ instructions including arithmetic, logic, memory, and control flow
- Separate instruction and data memory
- 5-stage pipelined datapath: IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB
- Hazard detection and forwarding logic
- Support for jump and link (JAL), procedure return (JR), and reverse operations (REVA, REVL, REVH)

## üß± Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

The processor supports:
- **R-type instructions**: ADD, SUB, SLT, AND, OR, XOR, NOR, SLL, SRL, SRA, ROR, REVA, REVL, REVH
- **I-type instructions**: ADDI, ANDI, ORI, XORI, LW, SW, BEQ, BNE
- **J-type instructions**: J, JAL, LUI

All instructions are 16 bits long. Immediate fields are sign-extended or zero-extended depending on the opcode.

## üîÅ Pipeline Details

The processor uses a standard 5-stage pipeline:
1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
2. **Instruction Decode/Register Fetch (ID)**
3. **Execution/Effective Address Calculation (EX)**
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**
5. **Write Back (WB)**

### Features:
- **Hazard detection unit** to insert pipeline stalls where needed (e.g., LW-use hazard)
- **Forwarding unit** to reduce stalls and improve performance
- **1-cycle penalty** for taken branches and jumps
- **PC-relative addressing** for branching instructions

## üß™ Testing

The design was tested through:
- Unit testing of ALU, control logic, register file, and memory
- Instruction-level testing for each supported opcode
- A complete sample program to sum the contents of an array via a function call using JAL and JR

### Example Test Program:
- Initializes an array with constants
- Passes the array base and size to a function
- Function calculates and returns the sum

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Download and install [Logisim-Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases).
2. Open `projv3.circ` in Logisim.
3. Load your test program into the instruction memory starting at address `0x0000`.
4. Run the simulation step-by-step or continuously and observe register/memory updates.
